{"name":"Timo Schlüter","tagline":"GitHub Projects and Portfolio","body":"### A few things about me\r\nI am a software developer born in '87 and living in Braunschweig, Germany.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 i started working at [GESIS Gesellschaft für Informationssysteme mbH](http://www.gesis.de), the IT subsidiary of german steel concern [Salzgitter AG](http://www.salzgitter-ga.com).\r\n\r\nMy background is in server-side applications with PHP and MySQL using LAMP stacks, although i am currently focusing on more \"hip\" web techniques such as AngularJS and Node. As for native app development i am looking into Swift on both the iOS and the OS X platform. My first project was an unofficial [Runtastic scrapper](https://github.com/timoschlueter/php-runtastic) and an OS X app for the [RocketBeans.TV Live Channel](https://github.com/timoschlueter/RocketBeans.TV-Sendeplan) on Twitch, both written in Swift.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### You want to hire me?\r\nIf you have an interesting job offer, please always feel free to contact me. I may not be actively looking for a job by myself but i am always looking forward to the next challenge in my career. :)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Contact information\r\nIf you have any questions about me, my projects or anything \bjob related, feel free to contact me using one of the following options:\r\n\r\n* [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/tmuuh)\r\n* [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Timo_Schlueter4?sc_o=mxb_p)\r\n* [Linked.in](http://de.linkedin.com/pub/timo-schlüter/77/555/a6/)\r\n* [Mail](mailto:timo.schlueter@me.com)","google":"UA-46375088-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
